The scent of fresh sawdust, the earthy aroma of newly-cut timber, the distinctive pungency of glue, and the nuanced fragrance of wood finishes — these sensory triggers whisk me back to my childhood. I vividly recall standing, rapt, watching my grandfather — a master cabinet maker — as he transformed raw wood into beautiful creations. Those olfactory memories have lingered, subtly steering my fascination and deep respect for the artistry of woodworking.

As a software engineer and entrepreneur, I've frequently found myself deeply immersed in the ever-evolving sphere of technology. A realm defined by relentless innovation, rigorous deadlines, and sometimes, overpowering stress. While my profession is certainly thrilling, it can, at times, be emotionally and mentally taxing. I've come to appreciate how woodworking provides an invaluable balance. It offers a tangible, down-to-earth sanctuary, a chance to decompress and recalibrate, allowing me to channel my creativity in an entirely different way.

And so, I've chosen to embark on my own journey into woodworking, taking inspiration from the innovative teaching methodologies at EPITECH, my alma mater. EPITECH’s pedagogy emphasizes practical, hands-on learning — an approach I believe is perfectly suited for mastering a craft as tactile as woodworking. This expedition commences with the 'Piscine,' an intensive, foundational phase intended to jump-start my woodworking prowess. 

Respecting my lifestyle, I plan to undertake my Piscine part-time over a span of three months. During this period, I aim to immerse myself fully into the realm of woodworking, concentrating primarily on hand tools — which have always held a quaint allure for me. There's something profoundly satisfying about using your own hands to carve and shape a piece of wood, about the tangible bond between the artisan and the material.

My aspiration isn't to morph into a commercial woodworker; instead, my passions lie in domains such as joinery, cabinet making, and crafting intricate boxes. I find myself inspired by the work of Nick Pedulla and James Krenov, maestros who’ve raised woodworking to the stature of an exquisite art form. My ambition is to interact with the timber, to take a raw piece and guide it towards becoming a beautiful and functional testament of craftsmanship.

Despite the undeniable rapidity and efficiency of machines, I am captivated by the intimacy inherent in traditional woodworking. The leisurely pace of hand tools, the direct engagement with the wood, the rhythm and tranquil quality of the work — these are facets that resonate profoundly with me. 

As I cast my gaze towards the future, I envisage this voyage into woodworking as more than just a pastime or a stress-reliever. Perhaps, when the day arrives that I yearn for a shift away from software engineering, woodworking could evolve into something more. It could present a fresh path, a novel means of expressing my creativity and applying my skills.

And so, here I stand, at the precipice of my Piscine, poised to plunge into the enchanting world of woodworking. This is a personal odyssey, fuelled by the yearning to learn, to create, to bring equilibrium to my life, and ultimately, to delve into a craft that has captivated me since childhood. As I stride ahead, I eagerly anticipate sharing my discoveries, my creations, and my experiences with you. 

After all, it's about the journey, not merely the destination.
