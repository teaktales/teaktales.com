Makha is valued for its extreme density, resulting in exceptional toughness, durability, and strength. The interlocked grain patterns provide additional structural reinforcement. Makha rates very high in hardness, making it suitable for the most demanding woodworking applications. Its rich reddish-brown color and resistance to decay make it an excellent choice for high-end furniture.
