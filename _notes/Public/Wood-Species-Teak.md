Teak is renowned globally for its exceptional strength and durability. It has a high resistance to decay, insects, and weathering due to its high density and natural oils. Teak rates very highly in stability, maintaining its shape and structure over time. It has straight, uneven grain patterns which give it visual interest. The rich golden-brown color and moderate workability make Teak suitable for both indoor and outdoor furniture and woodworking.
