Here is a more detailed glossary focused solely on woodworking terminology:

# Woodworking Glossary

## A

**Adhesive**: A substance used to bond two materials together, such as wood joints. Common woodworking adhesives include wood glue, epoxy, and polyurethane.

**Air Dried Lumber**: Lumber that is dried by exposure to the air, rather than in a kiln. May still have a moisture content of 15-20%. 

**Annual Ring**: The layer of wood growth added to a tree in one year, including spring wood and summer wood. Rings are visible in the end grain of lumber. 

**Arris**: The sharp external edge formed by two surfaces meeting, such as the edge of a table. Planes and scrapers are used to soften arris edges.

## B

**Band Saw**: A power saw with a long, sharp blade in the form of an open-ended loop that is used to cut curves and irregular shapes. The blade rotates around two or more wheels.

**Bead**: A decorative rounded contour carved into a surface, such as an edge bead.

**Bench Dogs**: Pegs fitted into holes on a workbench to grip the stock being worked on. Used in conjunction with bench stops and vises.

**Bevel**: The angle between two surfaces that intersect. Chisels and plane blades are sharpened with bevels to cut different types of joints.

**Bow Saw**: A small hand saw with narrow blade held in tension in a C-shaped frame. Used for curved cuts in smaller workpieces.

**Brad Nail**: A small, thin nail with a small head, used for delicate nailing. Compared to finish nails, brads have thinner shanks. 

**Bridle Joint**: A woodworking joint where one member is slotted and the other member has a tenon that fits into the slot. Provides good alignment and resists racking.

## C

**Callipers**: An adjustable instrument used to measure diameters and distances. Helps with precision in woodturning and other lathe work.

**Chuck**: A device that holds a wood blank on the lathe for rotational turning and carving. May use contracting jaws or be expandable. 

**Coarse grit**: Sandpaper and files with grit sizes from 60-100. Used for rapid stock removal before finer grits.

## D

**Dado Joint**: A joint where a groove is cut in one piece to accept the full thickness of another piece, usually at right angles. Used in shelves, drawers, and boxing.

**Dovetail Joint**: An interlocking joint where trapezoidal projections on one piece fit into corresponding slots in the other. Resists pulling apart. 

**Doweling**: A technique where a wooden or metal dowel pin is fitted into matching holes in two adjoining pieces to act as a mechanical fastener.

**Drawknife**: A woodworking tool with a handle at each end and an angled blade in the middle. Used in a pulling motion to shape and debark wood.

## F

**Face Plate**: A large wooden disk screwed onto the headstock of a lathe to provide a mounting surface for irregularly shaped blanks that cannot be held by a chuck.

**Fiddleback figure**: A feature seen in some hardwoods like maple, with a fine rippled pattern resembling a violin back. Prized for visual appeal.

**Finger joints**: Interlocking end-to-end joints where the fingers of one piece fit into the spaces of the mating piece, like hands clasped together.

**Finish nails**: Headless nails with thinner shanks compared to common nails. Used for more delicate nailing tasks where minimal impact is desired.  

**Floating Tenon**: A separate tenon, usually made of a contrasting wood, which fits into mortises in two mating workpieces to act as a mechanical connector. Allows for wood movement.

## G

**Grit**: The coarseness or fineness of sandpaper, files, and grinding wheels, indicating the number of abrasive particles per area. Higher grits remove less material.

**Gouge**: A chisel with a curved cutting edge used for scooping, hollowing, or carving concave surfaces. Many types for specific woodturning and carving tasks.

## H

**Hand Plane**: A woodworking tool used to flatten, reduce thickness, and smooth surfaces by planing away thin shavings of material. Many types for specific functions.

**Heartwood**: The inner layers of wood that no longer contain living cells or actively conduct sap. Typically darker and more decay resistant than sapwood.

## I

**Incised Carving**: A style of hand carving where outlines and shallow cuts are made with gouges before wood between incisions is removed with chisels. 

## J

**Janka Hardness**: A rating for the relative hardness of wood, measured by the force required to embed a 0.444" steel ball into the wood to half the ball's diameter.

**Joints**: The junctions where two or more pieces of wood are fastened together. May use adhesives, mechanical fasteners, and interlocking wood geometry.

**Jointer**: A stationary woodworking machine with a long bed and rotating cutter head used to flatten, straighten, and square lumber along the faces and edges.

## K

**Kerf**: The slit made by a saw blade as it cuts through material. The set of the saw's teeth make the kerf slightly wider than the blade thickness.

**Kiln Dried Lumber**: Lumber that has been dried in a heated kiln to achieve a target moisture content, typically 6-8% for furniture applications. Minimizes warp.

## L

**Lap Joint**: A joint where two pieces partially overlap each other. May be half lap (half thickness), cross lap, or other variations. Mechanically strong when glued.

**Lathe**: A woodturning machine with headstock and tailstock components that spin the wood blank while tools are applied to shape it.

**Live Edge**: Lumber milled so that the natural exterior edge of the tree is maintained, highlighting the organic shape. Popular for tables.

## M

**Miter Joint**: Joint created by bevel cuts (miters) to form an angled corner. Strengthened by splines, dowels, etc. Common in trim and framing.

**Molding Plane**: A specialty hand plane for cutting decorative profiles like beads, coves, rabbets, and fluting. The sole's edge matches the desired profile.

**Mortise and Tenon**: A joint where a square hole (mortise) in one part receives a projecting tenon on the end of the mating part. Very strong mechanical fastening. 

## N

**Nail Set**: A metal tool used after nailing to drive nail heads just below the wood surface for a flush finish ready for putty. 

## P

**Pith**: The soft core at the structural center of a tree trunk. Lumber containing the pith is more prone to warping.

**Push Stick**: A wooden stick used to safely keep fingers elevated above the workpiece when making narrow rip cuts on a tablesaw or router table. 

## Q

**Quarter Sawn**: Lumber sawn so that the growth rings meet the face of the board at angles of 60-90 degrees. Yields distinctive ray fleck patterns. 

**Quartersawn figure**: Visually appealing grain patterns, like flecks or stripes, produced by quarter sawing lumber at certain angles to the growth rings.

## R

**Ripping**: The process of cutting lumber lengthwise parallel to the grain, often to width strips for use in projects.

**Router**: A high speed motorized rotary tool used with shaped cutters for cutting grooves, joints, decorative edges, inlays, and complex 3D forms. 

## S

**Scarf Joint**: A joint in which two pieces of lumber are joined end-to-end by overlapping and bonding them together. Provides greater length.

**Scraps**: The small leftover pieces of lumber from cutting operations. Can be repurposed for smaller projects or as accent inserts.

**Scrub Plane**: A plane with a heavily cambered iron used to rapidly remove wood and flatten surfaces. Used before finer planes.

**Seasoning**: Drying wood to reduce moisture content and improve stability. Done by air drying or kiln drying.

**Snipe**: An unintended dip or gouge formed at the end of a board by planers and jointers due the release of pressure at the cutter head.

**Spokeshave**: A small hand plane used for smoothing contoured or convex surfaces that are inaccessible to larger planes. The blade can be adjusted for depth of cut.

**Straightedge**: Any rigid board with a perfectly straight working edge. Used to check flatness and straightness of lumber and tool alignments. 

## T

**Tung Oil**: An oil derived from the seeds of the tung tree. Used to finish and protect wood due to its water resistance and deep penetration.

## V

**Veneer**: Thin sheets of wood glued onto core stock to provide aesthetic visual appeal. Rotary cut, flat sliced, and rift sliced are common veneer types.

## W 

**Winding Sticks**: A pair of precisely parallel sticks spanned across a surface to amplify any twist or winding along the board's length when sighting the gaps.

**Workbench**: Sturdy bench with vises used to securely hold wood while performing various woodworking tasks with hand tools and machinery.

**Workholding**: Techniques and devices used to firmly secure lumber in position as it is cut, shaped, assembled, or finished. Examples: clamps, vises, jigs.
