In a world increasingly driven by efficiency and mass production, I find myself drawn to the deliberate, patient art of traditional craftsmanship. As an amateur woodworker, this journey isn't just about creating objects, but about developing a deeper connection with the material and honing a craft that is as rewarding as it is challenging. The principles I outline here are more than guidelines for my work â€“ they are a reflection of my reverence for woodworking. By valuing simplicity, authenticity, and the inherent beauty of wood, I aim to create pieces that are not only functional, but also embody the spirit of traditional craftsmanship.

# While there is value in:

- Elaborate ornamentation
- Efficiency through machine production
- Exotic and novel materials
- Dramatic innovations in style
- Disposable and replaceable furniture

# I value:

- Simplicity and restraint to showcase the wood
- Meticulous craftsmanship and human touch
- Traditional materials and time-honored techniques
- Natural forms and the inherent beauty of wood
- Quality, durability and purpose in design

And while tools and technologies may aid the process, I believe lasting furniture comes from skill and care.

# For in my work:

- Individual pieces matter more than quantity
- The journey matters more than efficiency
- Lasting furniture matters more than fleeting trends
- Honesty and integrity matter more than perception
- Respect for the materials matters more than waste

And though I may not always live up to them, these evolving principles guide me. I embrace thoughtful innovation yet stay grounded in skillful craft.
